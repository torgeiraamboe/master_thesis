A \textit{differential graded algebra} (DG-algebra) can often be thought of as an algebraic gadget containing highly detailed topological information. Two such cases are the algebra of cochains, and the cohomology ring of a topological space. The latter is often easy to calculate, but the former contains in general much more information about the space we are interested in. In this thesis we explore the relationship between these two DG-algebras---more precisely some situations where these two algebras contain the same homotopical information. Such algebras are called \textit{formal} DG-algebras.

In order to understand which type of homotopical information a DG-algebra can contain, we construct obstructions to formality through higher cohomology operations---called \textit{Massey products}. We then generalize DG-algebras to \textit{$\A$-algebras}, and look at some ways to use this generalized theory as a unified framework for both DG-algebras and Massey products. This framework allows us to prove that a certain class of topological spaces---namely those with Lusternik-Schnirellmann category $1$---have formal cochain algebras.
