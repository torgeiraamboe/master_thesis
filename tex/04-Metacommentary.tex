This thesis is not meant to be short and concise---as this is in our opinion not the best way to deeply understand abstract mathematics. Thus there will be some lengthy explanations and some lengthy calculations in order to properly understand the material at hand. There will also be some intentionally vague sentences in order to build intuition and a more natural feeling for the theory. If a reader wants to quickly understand the meat of the thesis, or only go through the most important results, I have added below a list of where to find the central definitions and results. There is also a summary at the end, which quickly summarizes what has been done throughout the thesis. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Definition 1.4. (DG-algebra)
	\item Example 1.8. (Cohomology algebra)
	\item Definition 1.15. (Quasi-isomorphic DG-algebras)
	\item Definition 1.16. (Formal DG-algebra)
	\item Definition 2.4. (Massey products)
	\item Definition 2.5. (Vanishing Massey products)
	\item Theorem 2.10. (Formal $\implies$ vanishing Massey products)
	\item Definition 3.3. ($\A$-algebra)
	\item Definition 3.6. ($\A$-quasi-isomorphism)
	\item Theorem 3.10. (Kadeishvili's theorem)
	\item Corollary 3.15. (Trivial $\A$-structure $\implies$ formal)
	\item Theorem 3.23. (Vanishing Massey products + + $\implies$ formal)
	\item Corollary 4.10. ($\ls(X)\leq 1$ $\implies$ $X$ formal)
\end{enumerate}

We will try to explain all the details as they come up, but we do not at all claim that this thesis is self contained. We assume some familiarity with homological algebra and algebraic topology, as well as some general mathematical maturity.
