This thesis is the conclusion to my five year long mathematical endeavor at NTNU, and the five best years of my life so far. 

These years would not have quite different, had it not been for my supervisor, Gereon Quick. I owe him a lot for showing me the joy and depths of topology, for years of learning, inspiration and motivation, and for guiding me through this thesis. 

These years would also have been quite different, had it not been for the mathematical community at NTNU, especially ``Matteland'', which has been my second home for many years. It has been a platform for motivation, highly interesting conversations and fruitful discussions about mathematics and its set theoretic complement. 

I also want to thank all my friends in Delta---the student association for mathematics and physics---for allowing me to do other things outside of mathematics, and for encouraging me to grow as a person. The real masters degree is of course the friends we made along the way. 

Finally, I want to thank my family and my girlfriend, for their relentless love and support for all that I do, and have done over the years.
